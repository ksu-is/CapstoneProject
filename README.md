# CapstoneProject - Recipe Finder
## Logan Markle


This project will help you find a recipe with ingredients you already have.

* Input ingredients you have
* See a list of recipes that are similar to your existing ingredients
	* Each of these results will give you a list of ingredients you have which are needed and a list of ingredients you will need to buy
	* Eventually if given enough time in the semester I would like to add prices of the needed recipes
* Add several recipes to your "cart" and will give you a list of ingredients to buy
* This website should show all recipes until you start inputing ingredients


I am planning to do this project in Flask, found [this tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)
