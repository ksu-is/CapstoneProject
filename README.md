# CapstoneProject - Recipe Finder
## Logan Markle

![](poster/poster-5-11-50.png)


This project will help you find a recipe with ingredients you already have.

* Input ingredients you have
* See a list of recipes that are similar to your existing ingredients
	* Each of these results will give you a list of ingredients you have which are needed and a list of ingredients you will need to buy
	* Eventually if given enough time in the semester I would like to add prices of the needed recipes
* Add several recipes to your "cart" and will give you a list of ingredients to buy
* This website should show all recipes until you start inputing ingredients


I am planning to do this project in Flask, found [this tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)



Timeline:
* 2/10 Finish Flask Tutorial(simple website and db setup) and find/combine recipes into one table
* 2/24 Basics website design with static content
* 3/16 DB/Dynamic content
* 4/6 Search
* 4/27 "Shopping cart" with recipe/ingredient list
* 5/8 Fixes and testing
